/**
 * The editing session of a document: the name Moodle and the editor use to talk
 * about the same thing.
 *
 * The key answers to two rules that look contradictory. It may not be reused for
 * content the editor has already seen —it would keep serving the copy it had, say
 * «the version has changed», and refuse orders about a session it considers
 * finished—; and it may not change while a document is open, or there is no way
 * to ask that session to save what it holds, which is what makes a submission
 * carry what was actually written.
 *
 * Both hold at once by renewing it exactly when the document changed since the
 * key was minted, which is why what was minted for is stored next to it. The
 * editor's own saves change the document but not the key: that session is alive
 * and stays reachable until somebody opens the document again.
